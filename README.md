Flights Delay EDA
The first project of the Data Science Bootcamp T5 is a Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for Flights Delay.

Abstract:

According to Federal Aviation Administration, the cost of flight delays in the US has been increasing for the past decade and it reached $ 33 billion in 2019. This project aims to conduct exploratory data analysis to analyze US airlines delay data set published by The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) to have a high level understanding on the delay causes.

Data:

• The Flights Delayis found on Kaggle. 
The dataset is provided in .csv format. It contains 1,936758 flight , each flight has 30 features. The most relevant feature to this project is the Flights Delay. It is obtained from DataExpo. 

Algorithms:

• Cleaning all data feature by removing all non-values, removing duplicated rows.
• Analyzing relationship between different data features.
• Filtering, aggregating delays to obtain overall delay time
• Conducting various data analysis on different causes to drive conclusions

Tools:

• Technologies: Python using Jupyter Notebook

• Libraries : Pandas , Matplotlib and Seaborn
